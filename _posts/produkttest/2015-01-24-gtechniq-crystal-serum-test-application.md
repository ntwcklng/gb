Crystal Serum from GTechniq is a coating that puts it all to the extreme. It is sold only to trained professionals. That is to make sure that no bigger damage to the paint is made. Using Serum the wrong way, you have to use 2000 grain sand paper.  
Well, that´s what the manufacturer says. 

If that is the truth – lets find out in this test.

The subject to testing was a VW Golf 5 GTI in Black Magic pearl effect. The paint has been polished with a machine (using a Rupes Duetto + Koch Chemie Anti Hologram + orange Lake Country Pad an other).

Don´t be irritated by the reflection looking a bit like bloom – the camera coudn´t handle the recflection of the flouroscent lamps very well.

The paintwork was prepared using GTechniq Panel Wipe to make sure that the paint was absolutely clean after polishing.

The Crystal Serum was applied to the paint using the included applicators.

Thanks to the pipette an economical dosing was pretty simple.

During the application of the product, you can already feel a noticeable difference to other well-known coatings like CQuartz and others.

Directly after the application, the product was buffed of with a short piled microfiber towel.

**Oooops !**  
We coated the complete hood of the car, but on a small area we unfortunately forgot to buff off the product in time ;-)

![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020281.JPG)

Seperated in 3 sections, we let it „dry“ for 8, 12 and 15 Minutes and tried to buff it of afterwards. Well, with no great success.

##Test 1: GTechniq Panel Wipe

The mildest method – the Gtechniq Panel Wipe. Of course that´s what we tried first.

![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020290.JPG)


![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020291.JPG)

Didn´t work in any way - 0% improvement. Failed !

![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020292.JPG)

##Test 2: Clay Bar
Maybe the clay bar does the trick. After all, it is slightly abrasive.

![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020294.JPG)


![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020295.JPG)

No, it failed too!

![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020296.JPG)

##Test 3: Finishing polish and DA Polisher    
In our case: A common Dual Action Polisher (DAS-6), an orange polishing pad from RotWeiss and Menzerna 4000. Started up on stage 2 and after a short time going up to stage 6, applying a lot of pressure to the polishing pad until the polish was ready to be buffed off.

![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020299.JPG)


![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020301.JPG)

We notce a first success! A **slight** improvement is visible.  

![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020302.JPG)

Of course, not quite good enough for us. Failed !

![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020303.JPG)

##Test 5: Polishing Compound and Dual Action Polisher  
Menzerna 2200 + orange RotWeiss Pad. Same approach to it like the previous test.  

![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020304.JPG)


![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020305.JPG)

To cut a long story short - no noticeable improvement. Failed! 

![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020306.JPG)

##Test 6: Test 6: coarse, hard pad, heavy grinding compound and rotary polisher
Green Rupes Pad (100mm) and Menzerna 400 at about 1200 rpm using medium pressure

![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020307.JPG)


![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020308.JPG)


![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020309.JPG)

Although a slight improvement was visible, this combination failed, too.

![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020310.JPG)

Now it gets even more exciting. We could have tried a lambswool pad. But we divined: That wouldn´t do the trick either!    
The persistant residue of the serum  

![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020311.JPG)

##Test 7: Kovax dry sanding Block
3000 grain  
![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020312.JPG)

Without applying any pressure to the block, simply let the sanding block slide over the paintwork in straight lines. Very important: beat out the block occasionally (f.e. on your jeans) to get rid of the removed material in the sand paper!

![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020314.JPG)

As we noticed quickly, that wasn´t enough, too. The surface was sanded enough, but the little dots remained unaffected. 

![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020315.JPG)

As you can see here nicely: the remaining residue of the Serum. We could have continued with the 3000 grain paper, but that would have taken far too much time.

![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020316.JPG)

##Test 8: 2000 grain
Heureka. The residues have gone – thankfully. Kovax Sand Block with the pink sand paper and the surface is recovered.

So, finally one thing should be clear by now: This stuff is sold to professionals only and deservedly so!


![GTechniq Crystal Serum](https://glossbossimages.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/marvin/serumschleifen/P1020319.JPG)

The remaining sanding marks have been eliminated using the combination from test 6 afterwards.

In conclusion, one can say that such a coating has, besides to the enormous life time, quite some risks, too. Expecting taking these rsiks from a beginner would be careless. 

In this tests it was also shown, that it makes no difference how long the serum was left to dry on the paintwork. 8 or 15 minutes – it didn´t matter. There was no easy way removing it. When it is „too late“ cannot be said exactly. It depends on lot of factors like ambient temperature, humidity, amount of product that has been applied and much more. All these factors affect the dry time.

In this test, an uninspiring amount of clear coat has been killed. Here ist he summary of all tests and the final mirror finishing:

* 2x Finishing polish
* 1x polishing compound
* 3x grinding compound (heavy duty)
* 1x dry sanding 2000 grain
* 2x dry sanding 2500 grain
* 2x dry sanding 3000 grain

We doubt a beginner would have been able to eliminate these marks. The clearcoat thickness was measured frequently to minimize the risk of polishing through the clearcoat. How much clear coat was finally removed is hard to say. Punctual it´s been surely about 7 to 10 µm. On some paintworks, that amount could be about 1/4 to 1/2 of the clearcoat thickness!

Some last words about the serum: That stuff has proven again how resistant it is. And the slickness is just awesome!
